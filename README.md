## FairyMaker is mostly a proof of concept

My mom used to have a [weather fairy](https://web.archive.org/web/20091001224203/http://weatherpixie.com/index.php?place=EGLL&trooper=1&type=&htm=1) built into her blog, and when we were talking about it I thought, "I wonder if I could expand on that?"
Since I'm still just learning code, I'm using this idea as a way to expand my skills, as well as implement new things as I learn about them. *(For example there was no weather section at all until I learned more about APIs.)*



### Resources

The big one is the image assets. I am not an artistic person, but I do remember some of my favorite old dollmakers. I found a simpler one, but couldn't find a definitive way to reach out to the creator(s) for permission, so the assets will have to change eventually. [This is the dollmaker, Samantha Dressup.](https://web.archive.org/web/20090105170235/http://www.dollsmania.net/Samantha_Dressup.html)

Then there's the cursors, which can be found [here,](https://www.cursors-4u.com/cursor/2009/09/15/pink-glitter-pointer.html) [here,](https://www.cursors-4u.com/cursor/2009/09/15/fuschia-glitter-pointer.html) [here,](https://www.cursors-4u.com/cursor/2009/09/15/purple-glitter-pointer-3.html) and [here.](https://www.cursors-4u.com/cursor/2009/09/15/light-purple-glitter-pointer.html)

Finally there's the favicon icons, which can be found [here](https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/sparkles/) and [here.](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/magic-ball_12402385?related_id=12402385)
