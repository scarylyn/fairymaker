## FairyMaker is mostly a proof of concept

My mom used to have a [weather fairy](https://web.archive.org/web/20091001224203/http://weatherpixie.com/index.php?place=EGLL&trooper=1&type=&htm=1) built into her blog, and when we were talking about it I thought, "I wonder if I could expand on that?"
Since I'm still a beginner, I'm using this idea as a way to expand my skills, as well as implement new things as I learn about them. _(For example there was no weather implementation at all until I learned more about APIs.)_

### Resources

The big one is the image assets. I am not an artistic person, but I do remember some of my favorite old dollmakers. I found a simpler one, but couldn't find a definitive way to reach out to the creator(s) for permission, so the assets will have to change eventually. [This is the dollmaker, Samantha Dressup.](https://web.archive.org/web/20090105170235/http://www.dollsmania.net/Samantha_Dressup.html)

Recently I added a second type of fairy to design, [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20091214122250/http://www.dollzmaniadressupgames.com/ChaZie_Elf_Fairy.htm) was the dollmaker used.

#### All dollmaker assets belong to DollzMania. I want to give proper credits but cannot seem to find a way to reach out to any of the original creators through the wayback machine. I am willing to pull the assets upon request of the owners. If anyone knows how I can get in contact with any of the artists that designed specifically the ChaZie style of dollmaker for DollzMania, please have them reach out to me at scarylyn@gmail.com.
